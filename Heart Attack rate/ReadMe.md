Important points regading this code.
If anyone can change here , so feel free to commit...

I took a random dataset , that's a famous Titanic dataset.
I used the pandas library for analysis. After completion of analysis , I splitted the dataset into train and test.

then I applied ML algorithms. I just used two algorithms that are Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.
I could use so many , but I didn't. If anyone can use those the rest of the algorithms using "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier" and so.. , so you can use and commit as well.
