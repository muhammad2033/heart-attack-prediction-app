# heart-attack-prediction-app

I've created a user-friendly heart attack prediction app using Streamlit and integrated a logistic regression model with high accuracy. The model, trained on various health parameters, successfully predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on user input.

My interface allows users to input essential health metrics such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and more. Behind the scenes, the logistic regression model, saved as 'Logistic.pkl' using pickle , processes this information and delivers a prediction. The result is displayed promptly, providing users with valuable insights into their heart health.

This user-centric application not only showcases my technical skills in machine learning but also demonstrates a keen understanding of creating practical and accessible solutions for healthcare prediction. The inclusion of a congratulatory message for a healthy prediction adds a positive touch, making the tool user-friendly and encouraging.

In summary, my heart attack prediction app stands as a testament to my proficiency in machine learning and my commitment to making impactful contributions to healthcare technology.
